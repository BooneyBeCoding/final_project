Not \"Which stock to invest in?\" or \"What do I do with my X amount of money?\" There's so much interesting content to think about and we seem to never touch upon any of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2\n",

He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.\\n\\nThe agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.\\n\\nThe $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.\\n\\nThe proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.\\n\\nIf those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.\\n\\nThe measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.\\n\\nThe rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.\\n\\nAs lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.\\n\\nProgressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments.

Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. \\n\\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1.Don't FOMO**\\n\\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? \\n\\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\\n\\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\\n\\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\\n\\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.\\n\\n**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**\\n\\nWhen you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.\\n\\n**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**\\n\\nTaking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**\\n\\n We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? \\n\\nYou can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**\\n\\nThis is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.    1\n",
       "TL;DR: Learn from your mistakes. Don’t give up.\\n\\nI started investing in 2017. I was proud of myself after going from $5000 to $6000 then I started taking huge risks on penny stocks, adding more money to my account, and soon found myself down huge. I walked away when I was down $5000. I came back a year ago with a new outlook. I recognized I had been making the same mistakes over and over and there were the big lessons I had to learn:\\n\\n- be skeptical of a company you’ve never heard of; stay away completely until doing lots of research.\\n- hold good-performing stocks for a long time\\n- gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.\\n- read the news (world news, national news, etc.)\\n- make a plan and stick to it unless you learn information that gives you evidence that your plan is worth changing.\\n- take advantage of the worst stock market crash ever (LOL)\\n\\nI’m not an expert, I just wanted to share my story and offer hope to people who are newer investors who are losing lots of money...take a break, refocus, and come back when the time is right for you.\\n\\n[Pics of my 1-year performance and my overall performance](https://imgur.com/a/616Fm5D)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.\\n\\nIf you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.\\n\\nThe entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.\\n\\nBut as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.\\n\\nThe main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was. Any additional insight from anyone would be great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
