       "This is a selfish post because I'd actually like some high level discussion instead of shallow discussion of fad stocks.\\n\\nSo many of these posts are \"Give me fish\" when--if people are really serious about investing--posts should be \"How do I fish?\" related.\\n\\nFor example, how much importance do you put on the P/E ratio?  Does it differ by sector? Are there any instances where you'd disregard it?\\n\\nThat's just a hypothetical, but it's the kind of discussion that I'd absolutely love to see on this sub.  Not \"Which stock to invest in?\" or \"What do I do with my X amount of money?\" There's so much interesting content to think about and we seem to never touch upon any of it.

       "We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. \\n\\n1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean \\n\\nTime in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. \\n\\n“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. \\n\\nRather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. \\n\\n2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) \\n\\nIf you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? \\n\\nSure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. \\n\\nOnce you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. \\n\\n3. Generational wealth\\n\\nThis is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. \\n\\nEven on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. \\n\\n4. Compound interest \\n\\nSome call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. \\n\\n5. Dividends \\n\\nWhether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. \\n\\n6. On “timing the market”\\n\\nThis is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. \\n\\nSpending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. \\n\\nAt the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. \\n\\nI made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

       "# Introduction\\n\\nMy background; three years of work experience in the financial services industry for a large global firm in the area of asset management. My role is centred around financial statement analysis and basically, just performing due diligence into the fundamentals of a company. \\n\\nAnyways, the reason I decided to write up this guide for /r/stocks is that I frequent the subreddit quite often and although there are a few good posters here and there, it seems there is a lot of misinformation that goes around, and thus, I wanted to set out a foundation for a due diligence template that new investors can use so that they can have some sort of basic guideline in terms of what to look out for before buying or selling a stock.\\n\\nThink of this due diligence template as your starting block. Take it, use it, then modify it to suit your needs when you are comfortable. The template is intended to be adaptable and basic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1) What does the company do?\\n\\nStep number uno; figure out what the company does. This is where google is your friend. Simply type up the company's name or ticker into google and read what it is they do.\\n\\nIf you don't understand what it is the company actually does after looking through google, don't invest.\\n\\nIf the company deals with complicated business models that require technical knowledge which you don't have, for example; an early-stage biotech undertaking Phase II clinical trials, don't invest.\\n\\nIf the company is vague about what it does or you're using google translator to read their business description, don't invest.\\n\\nGenerally, the more complicated the business model of the company, the riskier it is to invest. This includes conglomerates that may be involved in many simple business ventures individually, but when bunched up all together, it becomes complicated to analyse and thus, the risk to invest increases (e.g. GE -- to this day, I still think no one knows what they actually do).\\n\\nSo you're probably wondering by now, what is all this talk about *risk*? Don't worry about that for now, we will get to it later I promise.\\n\\n# 2) News\\n\\nWhat is currently happening with the company? There is no point wasting your time on further sections of your due diligence process if the company has publicly stated its intentions to file for bankruptcy.\\n\\nContrary to step 1, this is where google might not to be your friend. There tends to be a lot of spam articles, advertisements or just plain misinformation on google news. Normally, I just spend a minute on google news before doing some more serious research on better news site such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) (again, simply search the company name).\\n\\nDo not slack off here. The easiest way to lose money is to buy into a stock when litigations or liquidity concerns are going on which you could had easily avoided with a few minutes of reading the news.\\n\\nAnother reason why the news is important is that it can tell you things that aren't on the financial statements. What you read on the news can and 99% will impact the subsequent steps of this guide i.e., financial statement analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n# 3) Revenue drivers\\n\\nRevenue is the second most important thing on a company's financial statements, in other words, how does the company make money?\\n\\nIf you're going to read only one thing on a company's financials (which I seriously suggest you do not do), then that one thing should be revenue.\\n\\nNow, I'm not going to go into too much detail of why revenue is important. That's not the purpose of this guide, I'm not here to teach undergrad finance.\\n\\nEssentially, just imagine I'm offering you to buy my lemonade stand. Now ask yourself *how you should go abouts* figuring out how much you should pay for the lemonade stand. If you don't know the answer to this, read up on the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and [discounted cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp).\\n\\nAnyways, let's move on. Revenue can be found on the first line item in a company's income statement. The breakdown of revenue (i.e., the drivers) can be found in the segment reporting section of the financial statements (just ctrl+f and look for 'segment').\\n\\nA quick sense check I like to do here before doing anything else is revenue growth over market cap growth for the most recent period (use excel).\\n\\nIf market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth, that's probably a bad sign. Keep in mind that it's not an absolute indicator you should steer away, but it's just a quick and dirty calculation that gives you a general idea of where the stock is at in the market. Remember, we're trying to look for undervalued companies here, not hit blackjack at the casinos.\\n\\nThe two common reasons for why market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth is either that the stock is overvalued or that the market is predicting exponential revenue growth (i.e., revenue growth in the future should outpace this period's market cap growth).\\n\\nNext, let's figure out the revenue drivers.\\n\\nMost companies will have multiple revenue streams relating to different business operations, thus, it is important to figure out which one of those streams are driving revenue and by how much -- revenue stream divided by total revenue.\\n\\nThen, we look at the growth of each revenue stream over the most recent periods. Simply looking at revenue on its own is useless without looking at growth e.g., if revenue growth is declining, you can sure as hell bet that the stock price is declining too.\\n\\nAssuming you have done both of the above and listed them in descending order, you should now be able to determine which ones are the core revenue drivers.\\n\\nPersonally, I like to use the [BCG Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth%E2%80%93share_matrix) as a guideline when looking at the qualitative nature of the revenue drivers but everyone has their own way of doing things.\\n\\nIf the company is generating most of its revenue from Dogs, that's probably a bad sign.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not going to go through what each combination of the BCG Matrix means, have a read through the wikipedia as the information is all there.\\n\\nThis is usually the time when I can determine whether I should spend additional time analysing the company or move onto the next.\\n\\nIf you proceed, here is where things start getting quantitative and time intensive. \\n\\n\\n\\n*Note: In case some of you do not know where to get a company's financial statements, go to the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Simply search for the company's name, then search for filling type '10-K'.*\\n\\n**To be continued in Part 2**\\n\\ntldr;\\n\\nThere is no tldr.
