       "We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean \\r\\n\\r\\nTime in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. \\r\\n\\r\\nRather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? \\r\\n\\r\\nSure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. Generational wealth\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. Compound interest \\r\\n\\r\\nSome call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Dividends \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. \\r\\n\\r\\n6. On “timing the market”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. \\r\\n\\r\\nSpending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. \\r\\n\\r\\nI made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",

He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nProgressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.

       "This is a selfish post because I'd actually like some high level discussion instead of shallow discussion of fad stocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many of these posts are \"Give me fish\" when--if people are really serious about investing--posts should be \"How do I fish?\" related.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, how much importance do you put on the P/E ratio?  Does it differ by sector? Are there any instances where you'd disregard it?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's just a hypothetical, but it's the kind of discussion that I'd absolutely love to see on this sub.  Not \"Which stock to invest in?\" or \"What do I do with my X amount of money?\" There's so much interesting content to think about and we seem to never touch upon any of it.

       "For those unfamiliar, the Japanese stock and property markets by 1989 had run up to absurd valuations (the Nikkei 225 hit a Shiller CAPE of 80) and then collapsed, never to recover. I used to think this massive bubble proved you can’t just buy and hold ignoring all fundamentals and valuations, but recently came across this: https://ritholtz.com/2017/10/japan-greatest-bubble-time/\\r\\n\\r\\nKey takeaways:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Never underestimate how far people can take the markets to the extremes. This works in both directions. The pendulum swings back and forth but always seems to go further than most would assume is possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n> **Valuations don’t work as a timing tool. If you tried to use them in Japan you probably would have gotten out of the market a decade before the peak.** It’s easy to say this in hindsight, but there were few scenarios where the late-1980s real estate and stock market valuations could have been validated going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Diversification, as always, is the key to avoiding a blow-up. The entire point of diversification is to avoid having your entire portfolio in a Japan situation. The global stock market has done just fine since 1990 **even when you include Japan in the results.**\\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets you might’ve deiversified into that would’ve saved you: Japanese government bonds, Japanese small cap and value stocks (the Nikkei 225, as name suggests, only has mega caps), and foreign real estate.

       "Inspire Brands Inc. will buy Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. for $11.3 billion including debt, the companies said, setting up one of the largest restaurant deals in years as some in the industry think beyond the coronavirus pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deal is the second-largest acquisition of a North American restaurant chain in at least a decade, behind the $13.3 billion deal for Tim Hortons by Restaurant Brands International Inc. in 2014, according to investment data provider Dealogic. Inspire, the owner of Arby’s and other chains that is backed by private-equity firm Roark Capital, said the deal will make it the second-largest U.S. restaurant chain by domestic sales after McDonald’s Corp. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, the companies said on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspire said its all-cash deal to take the owner of Dunkin’ coffee shops and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores private would value it at $106.50 a share, a 20% premium to its closing price on Oct. 23, before the New York Times reported last weekend that the two companies were discussing a possible deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price of $106.50 a share would give Dunkin’ a market valuation of $8.8 billion. The chain’s stock closed on Friday at $100, up 32% this year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inspire-brands-to-acquire-dunkin-brands-group-for-11-3-billion-including-debt-11604102999)

       "Just a friendly reminder. This is a great time to understand companies and determine what your buy list is. Watch the market, but don’t overreact in either direction. Patience and savvy pays off in the end. Take this time to get smarter and learn. Assemble your buy lists. I still think it gets worse before it gets better. This is a fantastic opportunity, although a very tragic event. Save as much capital as you can and place limit orders if you believe in your picks. Hope you all are safe and healthy. Good luck out there.

       "Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.\\r\\n\\r\\nLampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Homes to Hardware\\r\\n\\r\\nThat business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the \"Wishbook,\" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the \"softer side of Sears\" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the \"next Warren Buffett.\" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its \"everyday low prices,\" while Target served up \"cheap chic.\" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, came a double blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).\\r\\n\\r\\nIts key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,\" he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html). Several of late, like Toys R Us and department store Bon-Ton, have been forced to liquidate. It is difficult to make changes needed, like investing in e-commerce, stores and a company's brand, while still catering to creditors' demands.    1\n",
