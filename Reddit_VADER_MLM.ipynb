He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nProgressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",

       "What the title says. This high-market-valuation situation isn't going to change despite all the warning cries of value investors, until and unless the US gov stimulus stops and it begins to unwind/extricate itself from the financial markets & banks. So, my question is, how will that happen and what will The Great Unwinding look like when it does?\\r\\n\\r\\n• what is the effect on markets when bond/corporate bond-buying by the Fed ceases, and who loses and who benefits (this may involve tracking individual companies to short/buy based on their debt and credit facilities utilization)?  \\r\\n• what is the effect on markets when windows close on Cares Act related loans and grants, and who loses and who stands to benefit? What do we look for there?  I've read an article that said no one knows what companies will actually be solvent and which will not because that info is currently hidden behind the loans and grants.  \\r\\n• what is the effect on markets when the window closes on Cares Act related unemployment benefits, and which stocks stand to lose and which stocks stand to benefit (bank/credit stocks lose & defensive Wal-mart style stocks benefit?)?  \\r\\n• what is the effect on markets if this new stimulus package proceeds, as they suggest it will, in mid to late July?  \\r\\n• how will The Great Unwinding of the most massive stimulus ever affect inflation and what are the factors that can tip us to inflation or deflation? (This is very relevant to me because investing in some foreign stocks as a hedge against a big inflation move of the USD is a part of my strategy)?   \\r\\n• what is the true risk of downside so long as the Fed and the US gov has its stimulus hat on? What factors, if they exist, could defeat the US gov's attempts to prop up market values during this time and are they so-called \"tail-risk\", \"black swan\" events like a new SARS-CoV emerging while SARS-CoV2 is still in pandemic mode?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know about anyone else but being on top of these questions seem more relevant to my investment decisions for the rest of the summer & early Fall than the things that value investors typically look at. As far as coronavirus infection factors, I think every investor is looking at those, so I think analyzing the stimulus and how The Great Unwinding might go down is the only thing I feel I haven't gotten a handle on. I think it would be cool if reddit get good at analyzing this aspect of our current market situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny suggestions?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

       "\\r\\n\\r\\n>The United States engaged in roughly $608 billion worth of research and development in 2018. That figure includes R&D by all entities in the US, from universities to private and public corporations. During the same year, corporations in the S&P 500 spent $806 billion buying back their own stock. In other words, the 500 largest companies in the US are now spending 33% more on their stock buyback programs than the entire country is investing in R&D. Cumulatively, buybacks have now outpaced R&D investment for the last five years.
