       "This is a selfish post because I'd actually like some high level discussion instead of shallow discussion of fad stocks.\\n\\nSo many of these posts are \"Give me fish\" when--if people are really serious about investing--posts should be \"How do I fish?\" related.\\n\\nFor example, how much importance do you put on the P/E ratio?  Does it differ by sector? Are there any instances where you'd disregard it?\\n\\nThat's just a hypothetical, but it's the kind of discussion that I'd absolutely love to see on this sub.  Not \"Which stock to invest in?\" or \"What do I do with my X amount of money?\" There's so much interesting content to think about and we seem to never touch upon any of it.

       "We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. \\n\\n1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean \\n\\nTime in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. \\n\\n“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. \\n\\nRather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. \\n\\n2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) \\n\\nIf you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? \\n\\nSure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. \\n\\nOnce you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. \\n\\n3. Generational wealth\\n\\nThis is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. \\n\\nEven on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. \\n\\n4. Compound interest \\n\\nSome call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. \\n\\n5. Dividends \\n\\nWhether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. \\n\\n6. On “timing the market”\\n\\nThis is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. \\n\\nSpending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. \\n\\nAt the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. \\n\\nI made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.

       "\\n\\nEdit 3: I went ahead and bouts some F, UNM and CTL but honestly I’m not seeing much out there. Everything is priced either fairly or overpriced and I’m not seeing any deals. I think we are at the top of this market. \\n\\n\\nEdit 2 : Since the MACD is about to cross over and RSI is so high I’m going to wait a few days before investing. FYI. But typically these value buys are good buys even at the top of a market.  \\n\\n\\nEdit 1: someone was asking what this means\\n\\nThis sorts all companies in the s&amp;amp;amp;p500 by a value function. The function uses quarterly earnings growth, price to book ratio, peg ratio, 52 week change. The list is sorted by each metric and each company is assigned a value. For example the company with the lowest price to book gets 1 point. The company with the second lowest price to book ratio gets 2 points. And so forth. After all the metrics are added up there’s a total value and the entire list is sorted by that total value. Ford has a total value of 236 which means it’s the best of all the metrics combined. and if you look at the numbers you can see why. Last quarter’s EPS went up 600%. \\n\\nIt’s then up to you to examine the company and decide if you want to buy. Looking at Ford it’s revenue went down 50% and it’s EPS was already low so it didn’t take much for it to rise 600%. Net income and cash on hand went up so they must have laid off lot of people. \\n\\nYou do this for every stock etc. this is just to give you a list of companies that stand out for you to pay attention to and possibly invest in. Based on this I would say Ford will survive and it’s a good buy at these prices. But you have to make your own mind up. That lost revenue looks terrible. \\n\\n———\\n\\n\\nLink to previous post [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hxsoou/created_a_list_of_under_valued_stocks_for_you/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\nLink to the post that got this started [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g4a598/created_a_list_of_under_valued_stocks_for_you_guys/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\nYada Yada Yada\\n\\nHere's the link for today\\n\\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AyaKWNyeEW8cHIKVzpsV0m8uUqhOkWUnMPSr4hreBKM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AyaKWNyeEW8cHIKVzpsV0m8uUqhOkWUnMPSr4hreBKM/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly every company has reported Q2 earnings. \\n\\n\\n\\nI was very surprised to see Ford (F) at the top of the list. UNM looks attractive although I wish I would have got in at $17. \\n\\nHIG also looks attractive. There's a lot of stocks that look attractive that didn't show up last time I posted because I only included companies that had reported earnings. Now that most have reported earnings I can feel more confident making these value purchases. \\n\\nHere is is a list sorted by industry and filtered by only good buys with a total value of 1000 or less (the smaller the number the better the score)\\n\\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPekCvsFZnt1I4wPXn\\_Kpv6oWbx-P5qhM-MesTXaQnk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPekCvsFZnt1I4wPXn_Kpv6oWbx-P5qhM-MesTXaQnk/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is a list of companies that did not lose money during the worse quarter ever.

If you take the above and delete any company that has a book value greater than 2 then you have a very solid value list\\n\\nEdit: the first link with all the stocks got sorted by symbol instead of by total value.

State energy giant Saudi Aramco is offering unprecedented discounts in Asia, Europe and the U.S. to entice refiners to use Saudi crude.\\n\\nAt the same time, Saudi Arabia has privately told some market participants it could raise production much higher if needed, even going to a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.

       "On Wednesday **Nike** announced that it was to stop selling its clothes and shoes directly to customers on **Amazon**. The move is a potential watershed moment for the retail industry in general (and Amazon in particular) as strong brands realize that traffic driven to their own site is self-sustaining, more profitable, and actually brand enhancing.  That’s good news for brands and bad news for Amazon.\\n\\n**Disney** had a good week with over 10 million signing up for its new streaming service. There were a few initial technical glitches but overall the app and the backlog catalogue were well received. The Star Wars based series, The Mandalorian, also received very positive feedback. However some commentators noted the lack of content for adults and questioned how long customers would be happy to watch the old classics. It’s an important question for Disney. The catalogue of classic content gives it a head start but it will still need to get up and running fast with consistent high quality (and expensive) new material. \\n\\n**Alphabet** said it was exploring ways it could “partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,”. It’s the latest attempt by the company to break into the highly regulated world of finance. However, the partnership approach with banks (rather than competing with them) seems more likely to succeed and the opportunities for Alphabet to provide useful tools and Google Pay should benefit all parties. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Growth stocks (Farfetch, Amarin and Grocery Outlet)** \\n\\n**Farfetch’s** stock is up 29% following a Q3 earnings beat with revenues up 90%, GMV up 59%, gross profit up 70% and guidance raised. \\n\\nFarfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries.  Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.  \\n\\nSignificantly, Farfetch reported that the site’s top 10 brands (including Gucci, Prada and Fendi) had doubled the amount of stock they listed on the site (versus a year ago) and that more than 100 new luxury brands (including Stella McCartney and Brunello Cucinelli) have joined the platform.\\n\\nThis rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Amarin** rose 33% in a week that saw the FDA Advisory Committee vote unanimously to recommend approval of Vascepa label expansion.  However its current valuation (market cap $8.62 billion) still looks cheap compared to the huge opportunity that looks increasingly like it is about to become a reality.\\n\\nVascepa is currently approved to reduce triglycerides. The label expansion under consideration would allow it to be prescribed to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes that affect millions of patients in the United States and are estimated to cost $500 billion annually. That’s not all up for grabs, but Amarin estimate there are 50 million people in the US alone who could benefit from the drug.  30% of that market at $1,000 p.a. would yield $15 billion in the US alone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Grocery Outlet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Monday with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).\\n\\nThe company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers. \\n\\nI was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. It is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.\\n\\nThe two drivers for this business are;\\n\\n1.  There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores\\n\\n2. Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.\\n\\nThe stock isn’t cheap on 43x current year estimates but the valuation appears very justifiable.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Value stocks (Tyson Foods and Verso)**\\n\\n**Tyson Food's** rose 10% this week despite narrowly missing estimates on the top and bottom line and reporting a 33% drop in EPS (from the record year that was 2018). Nevertheless Q4 sales were up 9% and CEO Noel White said “We’re very optimistic about fiscal 2020, and we currently expect to meet or exceed our long-term earnings algorithm of high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth as we’re well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.”\\n\\nThat optimism seems well placed. Tyson reported that its in-house rival to Beyond Meat, Raised & Rooted, now supplies fake-chicken nuggets to around 7,000 stores. Significantly more than the 4,000 it had previously estimated.\\n\\nIt also bodes well for other Tyson Raised & Rooted products; the chicken nuggets were essentially a pilot offering. The next one that'll hit store shelves is a blended hamburger that's a combination of Angus beef and plant protein.\\n\\nThe company also received a welcome boost on Thursday when China lifted its 4 year ban on US chicken products. All in all the stock looks relatively cheap (no pun intended). Even after the rise the stock is valued on a trailing PE of 16.36 and just 13.5x current year estimates. That compares favourably to the 5 year historic annual growth rate of 16.5%.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Verso Corporation**, the paper and pulp company, has struggled as demand for paper products has weakened. However my interest was aroused by the announcement this week that it has agreed the sale of Androscoggin and Stevens Point Mills for $400 million. The intention is to return a significant portion of the net proceeds to stockholders either by way of dividend or share repurchase. \\n\\nNow, I will highlight that I don’t know much about this industry and I expect there are many risks and costs involved with the business and the potential to offload the other mills. Nevertheless $400 million is a significant sum for a company with a market capitalization of $640 million. The company is currently valued at well under book value, has negligible debt and those 2 mills only account for around 20% of total capacity. If anyone has an insight it would be great to hear it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Speculative (****SmileDirectClub****)**\\n\\n**SmileDirectClub,** the online startup disrupting the orthodontic industry, saw its shares fall 26% after its earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress. Third quarter sales surged 50.6% to $180.2 million but losses widened (as expected) to $88.3 million from a loss of $14.9 million in 2018. \\n\\nHowever, in my opinion, the short term quarterly results are of little importance. To understand the value of the company you must balance the huge potential opportunity that faces SmileDirectClub against the pending legislation that could impose harsher regulations on online dentistry companies. \\n\\nIt is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide.  That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion compared to SmileDirectClub's current market cap of $3.3 billion.\\n\\nThe outcome of litigation processes are always extremely difficult to call. Nevertheless the stock offers a good balance of risk and reward. It is very high risk and potentially extremely high reward. Please be aware that this is a HIGH RISK highly speculative stock.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Insider (Comscore)**\\n\\n**Comscore’s** new CEO, Bill Livek, snapped up $1 million of stock on Tuesday (along with a few other insider purchases) following Q3 results last week. That should only enhance the strong incentives already in place for him to deliver a sale of the company at an advantageous value for investors. Livek, a 30-year veteran of the media and data measurement market, will receive a $1 million cash bonus from a sale. However, he will get an additional cash bonus (based on a percentage of the gross transaction if the sale yields $500 million or more in proceeds). That’s an 85% premium to Friday’s closing market capitalization of $270 million.\\n\\nIf you would like to see my regular updates during the week then please “FOLLOW” me.\\n\\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

       "# Company Overview\\n\\nPalantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.\\n\\nThey started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.\\n\\nLater they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.\\n\\nPalantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.\\n\\nPalantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.\\n\\n# Understanding the Business\\n\\n**Value Proposition**\\n\\nInstitutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.\\n\\nWhen it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.\\n\\nA central operating system for data\\n\\nPalantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.\\n\\nAugmenting existing data systems, not displacing\\n\\nAt a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.\\n\\nMaking data actionable\\n\\nGotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.\\n\\nTheir ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.\\n\\nUnderstand the history of data and decisions\\n\\nPalantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.\\n\\nEnable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances\\n\\nThe versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.\\n\\nUsers can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.\\n\\nEnforce rigorous and reliable data protection\\n\\nPalantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.\\n\\nAI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions\\n\\nTheir software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.\\n\\nThe AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.\\n\\n**Revenue Streams**\\n\\nPalantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.\\n\\nCurrently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.\\n\\nIt is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.\\n\\nGotham\\n\\nIts main tools include:\\n\\nGraph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.\\n\\nGaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\\n\\nDossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\\n\\nVideo – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\\n\\nAva – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.\\n\\nMobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.\\n\\nFoundry\\n\\nMonocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.\\n\\nContour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\\n\\nObject Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.\\n\\nFusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.\\n\\nReports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.\\n\\nI strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.\\n\\nPalantir’s Software Example Use Cases\\n\\n* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.\\n* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.\\n* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.\\n* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.\\n* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.\\n\\n# Industry\\n\\n**Market Size**\\n\\nAs of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.\\n\\nCurrently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.\\n\\nAccording to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.\\n\\n**Industry Fundamentals**\\n\\nEmbrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted\\n\\nIt has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.\\n\\nWe have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.\\n\\nBuy or Build\\n\\nInstitutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.\\n\\nAdditionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.\\n\\nPalantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\\n\\nCrisis & Instability\\n\\nA [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.\\n\\n# Competitive Landscape & Risks\\n\\n**Competition**\\n\\nPalantir’s main competitors include:\\n\\nInternal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.\\n\\nAnd two software companies with very similar business models:\\n\\n[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.\\n\\n[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.\\n\\n**Competitive Strategy**\\n\\nCustomer acquisition\\n\\nPalantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.\\n\\nAdditionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.\\n\\nSoftware engineers on the front line\\n\\nIn order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.\\n\\nLeverage experience in both private and public sector\\n\\nTo the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.\\n\\nPalantir’s strategic relationships last for years\\n\\nBy the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.\\n\\nPalantir has chosen sides\\n\\nTheir software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.\\n\\n**Growth Strategy**\\n\\nBecome the industry default\\n\\nPalantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.\\n\\nThis model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.\\n\\nContinue to grow their direct sales force\\n\\nPalantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.\\n\\nIncrease their reach with existing customers\\n\\nTo drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:\\n\\n* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers\\n* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities\\n* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases\\n\\nFor Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.\\n\\nBecome the default operating system for the U.S. government\\n\\nPalantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.\\n\\nPalantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.\\n\\nNew methods of customer acquisition and partnership\\n\\nAs Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.\\n\\nFor example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.\\n\\n**Moats**\\n\\nR&D expenditure\\n\\nSince 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.\\n\\nNetwork effects\\n\\nEvery data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.\\n\\nAt a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.\\n\\nAdditionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.\\n\\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\nSection 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.\\n\\nIn 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.\\n\\n**Other Relevant Risks**\\n\\nPrivacy and civil liberties\\n\\nPalantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.\\n\\nCustomer concentration\\n\\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.\\n\\n# Financial Summary\\n\\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\\n\\n[https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN](https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN)\\n\\n**Income Statement**\\n\\n[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)\\n\\nPalantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.\\n\\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:\\n\\n* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.\\n* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).\\n* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nPalantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.\\n\\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\\n\\n[https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw](https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw)\\n\\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020:\\n\\nNet cash provided by financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock\\n\\n# Investment Decision\\n\\n**Valuation Results**\\n\\n[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)\\n\\nThe result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**\\n\\nMayor assumptions of the valuation model include:\\n\\n* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.\\n* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.\\n* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.\\n* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%\\n\\nFollow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.\\n\\n**Investment Decision**\\n\\nI believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:\\n\\n* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.\\n* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.\\n* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.    1\n",
