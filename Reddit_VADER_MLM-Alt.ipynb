       "This is a selfish post because I'd actually like some high level discussion instead of shallow discussion of fad stocks.\\n\\nSo many of these posts are \"Give me fish\" when--if people are really serious about investing--posts should be \"How do I fish?\" related.\\n\\nFor example, how much importance do you put on the P/E ratio?  Does it differ by sector? Are there any instances where you'd disregard it?\\n\\nThat's just a hypothetical, but it's the kind of discussion that I'd absolutely love to see on this sub.  Not \"Which stock to invest in?\" or \"What do I do with my X amount of money?\" There's so much interesting content to think about and we seem to never touch upon any of it.

He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.\\n\\nThe agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.\\n\\nThe $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.\\n\\nThe proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.\\n\\nIf those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.\\n\\nThe measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.\\n\\nThe rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients.

       "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\\n\\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average annual gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\\n\\nWith an average annual net return of 39.1% after fees.\\n\\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\\n\\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\\n\\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\\n\\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\\n\\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\\n\\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\\n\\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\\n\\nThat certainly beats inflation...\\n\\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\\n\\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\\n\\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\\n\\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\\n\\n“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”\\n\\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\\n\\nStraus’ was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\\n\\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\\n\\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\\n\\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\\n\\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\\n\\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\\n\\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\\n\\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\\n\\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\\n\\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\\n\\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\\n\\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\\n\\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\\n\\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\\n\\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\\n\\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.\\n\\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\\n\\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\\n\\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\\n\\nFinally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\\n\\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.\\n\\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\\n\\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\\n\\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\\n\\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\\n\\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\\n\\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\\n\\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\\n\\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\\n\\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\\n\\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\\n\\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\\n\\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\\n\\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION:**\\n\\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\\n\\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**    1\n",
