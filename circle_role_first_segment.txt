# Circle Role create mockup of a database

Create mockup database using the reddit.csv making sure the model works.

*Note: For the final segment our Database needs to:

* Stores static data for use during the project
* Interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database   connects to the model)
* Includes at least two tables (or collections if using MongoDB)
* Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
* Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)

(an ERD is only reqired if SQL database is used)

## Goal

The 3 most prominent subreddits whose communities are built around the topic of stock market investing each have different constructions of culture. By running a sentiment-gauging cross-analysis over the headline/title of posts of each, can we teach a Machine Learning model to discern which of the subreddits was most likely the subreddit of origin?
